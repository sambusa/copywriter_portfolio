			<h3>Who Is Sam?</h3>
			<p>Sam is a freelance marketing professional who specializes in digital content. Since 2012, she has helped to rebrand small businesses and build consumer bases for startups through successful social media campaigns, email marketing, and search engine optimized web copy. She continues to work as a copywriter and copy &amp; design proofer for larger advertising agencies.
			<br><br>
			There are three things Sam was absolutely born to do in her life: travel to new places, meet new people, and tell stories. These callings combined  led her to become the unique copywriter that she is today, working with clients in every time zone across the US.
			<br><br>
			After graduating from Sarah Lawrence College in 2012, Sam took her skills straight to the Big Apple. In her first job as a freelance copywriter, she created SEO-targeted technical content for architecture and law firms and wrote blog posts about local attractions for apartment communities in big cities across the US. Looking to find a marketing niche, Sam dove into the world of high-end fashion when she landed her first desk job as the Senior Copywriter for Town Shop, the oldest lingerie store in Manhattan.
			<br><br>
			After two and a half years in New York City, Sam took a big risk and left to travel the country, pursuing freelancing full-time. Since then, her career has taken her to unimaginable places. Sam believes in creating content solutions that start with where the client is at, driving her to remain flexible, consistent, and hardworking. Wherever your business or brand is looking to go, Sam can get you there.
