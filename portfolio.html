				<div>
					<p>Manifesta is a salon... and so much more. Owned by three female stylists, Manifesta provides guests with beautifully crafted hairstyles, environmentally sustainable products, and socially responsible practices in a fun and inviting setting. As a value-driven company located in Downtown Oakland, Manifesta thrives off the belief that what is good for the community is also good for business. For this reason, Manifesta has a community-partnership program, 'Festa, which offers space for outside businesses, entrepreneurs, and artists to sell their local craft goods and services to guests in the form of kiosks, workshops, and more.
					<br><br>
					I began working as a freelance copywriter for Manifesta in fall of 2013. While the salon space was still in demolition phase, I built a social media following for the business and created much of the website's content with SEO implementation. Since its opening, I have managed and produced Manifesta's monthly and quarterly email newsletters, monthly blog posts, social media accounts including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google +, and occasional printed advertisements in the form of postcards. My voice for the business has been particularly vital in times of political and social relevance, such as when the government shutdown affected the loan that would open the salon and also when the Oakland riots in response to the Ferguson shooting resulted in physical damage to the salon's property. The Manifesta owners stand by every value they claim for the business, especially in community outreach, and it has been a privilege being a member of their team.

They connect providers (healthcare professionals) to Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Shield, and thousands of commercial insurance companies.
					<br><br>
					I started work as a freelance technical writer with Claim.MD in December 2014. During the course of their system's update and integration of groundbreaking features in the electronic claim industry, I was brought on to write and edit a user guide for new providers. With great detail, flexibility, and a wonderful working relationship with the owner, I created a user-friendly, search engine optimized digital user manual that kept up with Claim.MDâ€™s continual advances.

				<p>After over 125 years, Town Shop is the oldest and most famous lingerie retailer in New York City. Now in its third generation as a family-owned business, Town Shop brings offers a unique fitting experience. Each customer receives an individual fitter, expertly trained in sizing high-end bras across several brands without ever reaching for the measuring tape.

				<br><br>
				I worked as a copywriter at Town Shop from spring 2013 to spring 2014. As the only digital marketing professional on a small web team, I took authority in executing nearly all of the retailer's social media interactions, email marketing campaigns, web content decisions, and exchanges with online customers. My role was integral to the store's transition into a new website and an Amazon retailer account. In addition to writing countless, search engine optimized product descriptions for high-end fashion materials, I single-handedly built a large following and loyal online customer base through social media campaigns and email marketing. One of my favorite challenges was promoting Town Shop as one of the only lingerie stores with a high-end men's section through creative social media campaigns and the recruitment of men's fashion bloggers to feature new products.
