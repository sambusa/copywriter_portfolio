					<h5>COPYWRITING</h5>
					<p class="services_copy">Between every product and that moment when a consumer reaches into their wallet to make a purchase is the story of a brand. Copywriting is all about telling your brand's story in the most concise and compelling way possible. No one knows that story better than you; but without the knowledge of media and the time to devote to content, it will be completely lost on your customers. If you want to sell more, expand your business, or get your name out there, you need consumers to identify with your brand.<br>My copywriting services include:</p>
					<div class="center"><ul>
						<li class="services_copy">Website Copy (with HTML and CSS styling)</li>
						<li class="services_copy">Product Descriptions</li>
						<li class="services_copy">Printed Copy: Postcards, Flyers, Billboards, Menus, Mailers - You name it!</li>
						<li class="services_copy">Broadcast: TV, Radio, &amp; Online Videos (YouTube commercials, etc.)</li>
					</ul></div>
					<h5>EDITING</h5>
					<p class="services_copy">Maybe you already have a great copywriter on hand, but need help editing or proofreading advertisements before they go out. I have been proofing copy and editing for major advertisement agencies since 2014 and self-editing for smaller businesses for years. With the right <s>hands</s> <i>eyes</i> for the job, you can rest assured that your business is represented exactly as you planned.</p>

					<h5>SOCIAL MEDIA</h5>
					<p class="services_copy">Social media is one of the greatest tools for marketing because it's free, it's everywhere, and it's personal for the user. One mistake that many make when scheduling social media is treating each post the same across different platforms. I will give your social media presence the attention it deserves to ensure that your consumers feel compelled to interact and engage with your brand.</p>
